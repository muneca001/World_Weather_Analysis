# World_Weather_Analysis

In this project, I have developed a Python script to visualize the weather data of more than 500 cities located at different distances from the equator. To accomplish this, I have utilize the citipy Python library, the OpenWeatherMap API, and leveraged my problem-solving abilities to build a comprehensive and representative model of weather patterns across various cities. These findings can be found in the WeatherPy file under the WeatherPy folder.

Additionally, I have leveraged my weather data analysis skills to plan future vacations. Using Jupyter notebooks, the GeoViews Python library, and the Geoapify API, I have created an interactive and visually appealing platform to help users explore and select potential vacation destinations based on weather conditions and other geographical features. This information can be found in the VacationPy file under the WeatherPy folder.
